## Research questions

1. How is the **morphology of fringing reefs** distributed geographically? What are the differences along the parallel and vertical of the latitude?

2. Could we estimate the **environmental conditions**, such as SST and wave energy or wave height, by the morphology of fringing reefs?

3. Is the morphology of fringing reefs correlated with the **biodiversity**?

4. What is the **relation** between morphology of fringing reefs, environmental conditions and biodiversity?

## Rationale for that question

Fringing reefs are widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical zones across the world. The structure of fringing reefs provide the habitats for the intertidal and subtidal organisms (*Menard et al. 2012*). Meanwhile, the morphology of fringing reefs are shaped by the reef-building organisms and the environment factors (*Duce et al. 2016*). Previous researches have studied the growth and morphology of fringing reefs from geology aspect (*Kennedy and Woodroffe 2002*) and the bathymetric distribution of corals on the fringing reefs (*Dai 1993*). But the connection between biodiversity and morphology of fringing reefs and their geographical differences has not been studied.    

Fringing reefs can be easily observed from the satellite images in Google Earth. The differences of fringing reefs can be observed along the latitude (*Fig 1.*) or the different side of island. In this project, we would quantify several morphological traits of fringing reefs and try to explore their connection with environmental factors and biology. The spurs and grooves are the most distinct features in the fringing reefs. Therefore, our measurement would base on the morphological traits of the grooves. The assumptions are shown in *Table 1*.

|Morphological traits     | Environmental or Biological meanings | 
|:---                     | :---    |
|Width of groove          | narrow groove provide better shelter to avoid predators and physical disturbance    |
|Length of groove         | longer groove means better connectivity between intertidal and subtidal zone   | 
|Density of groove        | higher density means  more space can be utilized bu organisms  |
|Diversity of groove      | higher diversity means more niches can be utilized  by different species  | 
|Width of fringing reef   | larger width means the reef building process is better, which also means warmer SST and less wave energy  |

看群礁的型態是否有助於生物多樣性維持 其他擾動對於其影響
了解其在南北緯度上分布的界線 有助於海域資源管理 以及保育區規劃

## Data sources

Taiwan would be an ideal preliminary study site for this project. Because there are well-developed fringing reefs and sufficient biological and environmental data can be accessed. 

1. Satellite images: 
  - Google Earth
  - Planet Explorer

2. Environmental data: 
  - [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog) 
  - [Central Weather Bureau, Taiwan Government](https://www.cwb.gov.tw/V8/C/)
  - [Ocean Data Bank, National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan](https://www.odb.ntu.edu.tw/)

3. Biological data:
  - [IOCEAN, Ocean Affairs Council, Taiwan Government](https://iocean.oca.gov.tw/iOceanMap/map.aspx)
  - Local references or monitoring projects


## Proposed methods for data extraction and analysis

- Morphological traits of fringing reefs and their geographical location can be extracted directly by Google Earth or using **QGIS** by downloading the satellite images. They can be calculated by creating line features. For quantifying the morphological differences, the **resolution of images are needed to be greater than 3 m/pix**.

- Some morphological traits (such as density of groove) might be measured more efficiently by applying the **machine learning**. 

- By adjusting the **bands in the satellite images**. Morphological features might be extracted more easily.

## Limitation

當和生物多樣性指標做分析時，會有更多其他因子影響(如 人為活動或自然史)，因此最好選沒有人為活動的區域 
需要結合更精確地水下資料
生物多樣性資料應該要 看長期的波動 求其穩定性 不可只看一個時間點的值
水面上的結構是否與水下的有關?
需要現地或長期的生物調查資料支持更好
如何從不同尺度進行評估，考慮和沙子的組成，形態的多樣性?

However, the structure of fringing reefs can be complicated and have variable components. For example, some fringing reefs have lagoon and some of them have extended reef flat (Fig).
